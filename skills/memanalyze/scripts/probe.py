"""Runtime view discovery — the reason this skill runs on both openGauss and GaussDB.

The memory views differ by product, by version, and between centralised and
distributed deployments, in *both* their names and their column sets. So we
hardcode nothing: each slot lists candidate views in preference order, we ask
the catalog which of them exist and what columns they really have, and the
collectors build their SELECTs from that.

`select()` and `columns_expr()` are pure — "given what exists, which view and
which columns" is decided without touching a database, and is unit tested.
